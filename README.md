# About The Project

This project implements a finance management application to track investments, personal finance, budget, retirements, Financial Independence Retire Early movement FIRE, all stuff related to Personal Finance. 

## Background Information

When a business or an individual is in need of a loan, they reach out to loan originator. In most case, the loan originator does not have the money to give to this client. So, what the loan originator does is to float the loan and allow investors to fund it. The floating or display of a loan that need funding is done on a platform. Sometimes, the loan originator have their own platform.
Now, the investor does not just invest in one platform but in multiple platforms and at times with different loan originator on the same platform (now referred to as a market place as it has more that one loan originator). These bring us to our application, `Flow`, an investment management application.

Using Flow, an investor is able to take the information `after` investing in a platform and add it to our application for easier management. In the past, the investor would have numerous excel files that stored this data which is messy, not easily accessible and does not have that good user experience with tools such as sort, classify by, just ready available to them; so Flow.
