Investors can invest in a variety of projects and growth companies through the GLS crowd with amounts starting at 250 euros. Crowdinvesting is done by subordinated loans, which are repaid with interest during the agreed term. In contrast to other investment options such. For example, crowd investing is free of charge for investors in securities or investment funds. You only specify the amount of the loan - everything else is organized by the GLS crowd.</desc>    <g transform="matrix(3.59826,0,0,3.59826,2,110.094)">        <path d="M101.518,61.972c-0.126,-0.077
