Investors can buy shares in properties they select and can also be mortgage lenders in their own right. When making loans, investors receive a fixed interest rate of up to 4.4% p.a. paid monthly. Their capital is secured with a first charge against the property just like a high street mortgage. With Loan-To-Value ratios of between 50% and 70%, investors can expect a safe source of income.</desc>    <g transform="matrix(4.84441,0,0,4.8381,-3.33478,2)">        <path d="M106.171,52.5c0,28.995 -23.567,52.5 -52.638,52.5c-29.071,0 -52.638,-23.505 -52.638,-52.5c0,-28.995 23.567,-52.5 52.638,-52.5c29.071,0 52.638,23.505 52.638,52.5Z" style="fill:rgb(233,196,163);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>        <path d="M91.002,38.755c0.722,-21.133 -15.15,-36.655 -36.794,-36.655c-21.644,0 -38.942,17.583 -38.238,36.655c0.704,19.071 38.238,64.145 38.238,64.145c0,0 36.073,-43.013 36.794,-64.146Z" style="fill:rgb(240,81,27);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>        <path d="M73.666,39.038c0,10.985 -9.044,19.89 -20.201,19.89c-11.156,0 -20.201,-8.905 -20.201,-19.89c0,-10.984 9.045,-19.889 20.201,-19.889c11.157,0 20.201,8.905 20.201,19.889Z" style="fill:white;fill-rule:nonzero;"/>    </g></svg>
