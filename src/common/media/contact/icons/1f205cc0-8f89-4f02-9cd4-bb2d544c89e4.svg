Invested funds are converted into the loan business Loanstep and provide a return based on the interest from repaid loans. As a borrower, there is also the opportunity to become an investor, partly through repayment of loans, and partly by taking part in the loan school. The expected return on invested capital is 7 - 9%.</desc>    <g transform="matrix(21.25,0,0,21.25,38.2141,1)">        <path d="M13.17,12.11l-4.37,1.89c-0.931,0.459 -1.963,0.676 -3,0.63c-0.842,-0.095 -1.605,-0.542 -2.1,-1.23c-1.647,-2.18 -0.88,-4.477 2.3,-6.89c0.982,-0.756 2.057,-1.381 3.2,-1.86c0.961,-0.418 1.968,-0.724 3,-0.91l0.56,1.53l2.94,-3.89l-4.7,-1.38l0.43,1.39c-1.162,0.137 -2.296,0.454 -3.36,0.94c-1.27,0.566 -2.468,1.281 -3.57,2.13c-1.934,1.305 -3.416,3.178 -4.24,5.36c-0.574,1.939 -0.108,4.044 1.23,5.56c1.84,2.407 4.507,2.86 8,1.36l4.6,-2c0,0 1,-0.34 0.5,-1.58c-0.5,-1.24 -1.45,-1.08 -1.45,-1.08" style="fill:rgb(46,134,171);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>        <path d="M7.33,11.89l4.37,-1.89c0.931,-0.459 1.963,-0.676 3,-0.63c0.842,0.095 1.605,0.542 2.1,1.23c1.673,2.2 0.923,4.507 -2.25,6.92c-0.988,0.758 -2.07,1.383 -3.22,1.86c-0.961,0.418 -1.968,0.724 -3,0.91l-0.56,-1.53l-2.97,3.87l4.69,1.37l-0.43,-1.39c1.162,-0.137 2.296,-0.454 3.36,-0.94c1.275,-0.562 2.478,-1.277 3.58,-2.13c1.934,-1.305 3.416,-3.178 4.24,-5.36c0.571,-1.941 0.102,-4.046 -1.24,-5.56c-1.833,-2.413 -4.5,-2.867 -8,-1.36l-4.6,2c0,0 -1,0.34 -0.5,1.58c0.5,1.24 1.45,1.08 1.45,1.08" style="fill:rgb(46,134,171);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>    </g></svg>
