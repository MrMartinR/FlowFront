Debtor is a FinTech company that was created from the idea of innovating companies' access to liquidity through technology. The invoice is an asset that too few companies use to improve their ongoing cash flow and operations. We have tried to change that so that more companies can benefit from the many benefits of invoice purchasing. Debtor offers additional funding that we believe should work. Digitally, easily, quickly, securely, flexibly and, above all, accessible when needed and outside the bank.</desc>    <g id="Combined-Shape" transform="matrix(18.2143,0,0,18.2143,10.1071,1)">        <path d="M2,16l14,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-14,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm9,-8l14,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-14,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm-9,0l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm15,-8l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm7,16l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm-22,-16l7,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-7,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm9,24l7,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-7,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm-9,0l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Z" style="fill:rgb(0,229,158);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>    </g></svg>
