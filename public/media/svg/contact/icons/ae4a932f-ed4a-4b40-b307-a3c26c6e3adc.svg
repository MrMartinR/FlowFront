From now on, RE investments are no longer reserved for venture capital firms or very rich entities: everyone has an opportunity to choose an RE project and invest an amount of their choice (from EUR 100). Only thoroughly verified and analysed real estate projects are presented on the platform. Moreover, NordStreet gives investors all information on the projects, their risks, guarantees, etc.</desc>    <g transform="matrix(9.65288,0,0,9.65288,386.893,182.937)">        <path d="M0,15.138l-24.822,-33.986l-13.094,0l0,52.834l10.927,0l0,-36.674l26.783,36.674l11.002,0l0,-52.834l-10.796,0l0,33.986Z" style="fill:rgb(0,170,168);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>    </g></svg>
