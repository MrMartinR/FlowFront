Investors can invest in a variety of projects and growth companies through the GLS crowd with amounts starting at 250 euros. Crowdinvesting is done by subordinated loans, which are repaid with interest during the agreed term. In contrast to other investment options such. For example, crowd investing is free of charge for investors in securities or investment funds. You only specify the amount of the loan - everything else is organized by the GLS crowd.</desc>    <g transform="matrix(2.8012,0,0,2.8012,-283.057,130.75)">        <path d="M101.518,61.972c-0.126,-0.077 -0.146,-0.31 -0.061,-0.624c0.22,-0.728 0.518,-1.416 0.886,-2.044l0.087,-0.155c1.78,-3.248 7.409,-9.783 25.09,-12.825c21.688,-3.734 50.409,-1.291 61.755,-0.311c1.894,0.161 3.739,0.305 5.494,0.419c0.003,0 1.112,0.054 1.112,0.054l3.257,0.197c1.417,0.065 2.753,0.108 3.977,0.134l0.363,0.003c1.079,0.011 3.935,0.105 5.629,0.015c1.07,-0.056 2.426,-0.177 3.861,-0.307l1.425,-0.123c0.213,-0.018 0.312,0.112 0.332,0.229c0,0.018 0.005,0.031 0.005,0.047c0,0.105 -0.059,0.219 -0.202,0.255c-4.934,1.218 -9.877,2.215 -15.889,2.874c-7.887,0.839 -15.688,0.987 -25.664,0.76c0.003,0 -0.482,-0.06 -0.482,-0.06c-1.251,-0.077 -1.372,-0.133 -3.407,-0.547c-0.065,-0.012 0.067,0.02 -0.2,-0.041c-0.266,-0.06 -0.296,-0.414 0.05,-0.423c0.228,0 0.477,0.002 0.477,0.002c7.992,0.027 10.108,-0.083 16.907,-0.39l3.024,-0.153l2.516,-0.222c0.251,-0.02 0.358,-0.376 0.356,-0.486c-0.002,-0.123 -0.186,-0.43 -0.594,-0.444c-0.094,0.005 -1.545,-0.076 -2.444,-0.114c-0.932,-0.041 -3.797,0.116 -3.797,0.116c-1.547,0 -11.581,0.453 -21.837,0.453c-0.444,0 -2.477,-0.164 -2.889,-0.255c-0.413,-0.092 -1.083,-0.121 -1.083,-0.121c-0.22,-0.048 -0.197,-0.339 0.038,-0.35c0,0 3.916,-0.363 7.499,-0.415c0.553,-0.007 3.326,-0.099 4.093,-0.148c0.594,-0.036 1.177,-0.152 1.177,-0.565c0,-0.515 -3.466,-0.515 -5.492,-0.515c-4.573,0 -14.085,0.874 -15.233,0.874c-1.538,0 -2.475,-0.343 -10.027,-0.343c-7.261,0 -14.76,0.82 -21.509,3.226c-6.806,2.423 -10.942,6.097 -12.404,7.563l-0.141,0.144l-0.245,0.24c-0.28,0.242 -0.659,0.482 -1.096,0.757c-0.675,0.426 -1.437,0.913 -2.19,1.594l-1.101,1.011l-0.934,0.859c-0.186,0.164 -0.377,0.226 -0.489,0.155Zm125.658,-17.132c-0.05,-0.112 -0.229,-0.125 -0.466,-0.033l-1.592,0.571c-8.44,3.024 -15.502,4.759 -23.612,5.802c-8.026,1.004 -15.529,1.067 -24.28,0.845c-0.036,0 -0.074,0 -0.108,-0.002c-0.406,-0.011 -0.451,0.345 0.036,0.502c0.042,0.013 0.09,0.029 0.139,0.045c1.919,0.571 4.642,1.069 6.333,1.163c10.079,0.283 16.831,-0.184 24.078,-1.672c4.862,-1.025 10.406,-2.482 17.965,-6.174l1.222,-0.605c0.233,-0.119 0.336,-0.325 0.285,-0.442Zm-16.862,8.512c-7.183,1.688 -13.747,2.26 -23.429,2.036l-0.392,-0.012c-0.15,0 -0.271,0.077 -0.292,0.184c-0.029,0.166 0.18,0.431 0.861,0.691l0.224,0.094l0.155,0.067c1.966,0.758 4.67,1.549 6.284,1.605c9.265,-0.033 15.598,-1.044 22.587,-3.607c3.728,-1.412 7.03,-3.046 10.711,-5.304c3.435,-2.134 6.587,-4.376 10.218,-7.281l0.677,-0.545c0.184,-0.15 0.258,-0.304 0.258,-0.428c0,-0.058 -0.016,-0.112 -0.047,-0.154c-0.085,-0.117 -0.285,-0.162 -0.496,-0.023c0,0 -1.073,0.715 -1.078,0.715l-2.746,1.693c-4.459,2.779 -8.413,4.882 -12.439,6.611c-3.733,1.587 -7.142,2.714 -11.056,3.658Zm-12.541,8.364c2.392,1.276 4.887,2.089 6.205,2.033c8.369,-0.874 13.971,-2.75 20.674,-6.924c3.261,-2.067 6.366,-4.504 10.379,-8.142c3.885,-3.522 8.097,-7.732 13.632,-13.388l0.246,-0.249c0.373,-0.376 0.998,-1.011 1.177,-1.213c0.22,-0.251 0.227,-0.455 0.139,-0.54c-0.092,-0.092 -0.323,-0.076 -0.603,0.182c-0.249,0.224 -1.271,1.089 -1.556,1.316c-1.925,1.544 -3.851,3.145 -5.155,4.277c-5.269,4.667 -9.409,7.971 -13.422,10.715c-3.777,2.554 -7.061,4.378 -10.652,5.918c-6.974,2.899 -13.222,4.094 -22.279,4.266c-0.63,0.034 -0.708,0.175 -0.719,0.218c-0.027,0.112 0.105,0.491 1.934,1.531Zm10.539,6.882c2.468,1.695 4.92,2.636 6.104,2.343c7.034,-2.397 11.798,-5.517 18.205,-11.935c3.147,-3.199 6.14,-6.665 10.559,-11.937l1.497,-1.796l6.12,-7.286c2.876,-3.367 6.368,-7.409 11.462,-12.782l0.948,-1.031c0.245,-0.269 0.267,-0.514 0.166,-0.619c-0.096,-0.101 -0.334,-0.094 -0.641,0.157l-0.901,0.753l-0.142,0.121c-2.882,2.455 -6.341,5.672 -8.606,8.001l-2.553,2.686c-5.831,6.119 -9.682,10.166 -13.213,13.625c-4.216,4.116 -7.22,6.705 -10.365,8.942c-6.649,4.64 -12.13,6.801 -20.227,7.967c-0.352,0.067 -0.552,0.195 -0.592,0.381c-0.061,0.26 0.15,0.915 2.179,2.41Zm11.372,8.882c2.571,2.141 4.97,3.107 5.965,2.412c2.749,-2.399 5.01,-4.826 7.577,-8.111c2.365,-3.048 4.609,-6.373 7.458,-10.749l1.592,-2.454c2.45,-3.8 5.23,-8.104 9.631,-14.202c2.62,-3.616 5.646,-7.675 10.025,-12.856c2.591,-3.042 4.925,-5.625 7.574,-8.371c3.558,-3.723 6.883,-6.913 10.781,-10.35c0.35,-0.316 2.242,-1.995 2.56,-2.246c0.634,-0.5 0.706,-0.885 0.558,-1.08c-0.155,-0.207 -0.58,-0.243 -1.002,0.058l-0.565,0.401l-0.973,0.693c-5.431,3.925 -11.316,9.168 -14.486,12.381c-5.586,5.783 -9.351,10.144 -12.585,13.995c-3.058,3.643 -5.355,6.517 -7.572,9.294l-1.038,1.298c-4.309,5.394 -7.156,8.958 -10.072,12.24c-3.15,3.513 -5.674,5.925 -8.441,8.066c-2.894,2.235 -5.707,3.882 -9.135,5.339c-0.255,0.139 -0.403,0.339 -0.432,0.599c-0.092,0.771 0.822,2.067 2.58,3.643Z" style="fill:rgb(0,84,166);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>    </g></svg>
