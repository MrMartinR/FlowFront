Debtor is a FinTech company that was created from the idea of innovating companies' access to liquidity through technology. The invoice is an asset that too few companies use to improve their ongoing cash flow and operations. We have tried to change that so that more companies can benefit from the many benefits of invoice purchasing. Debtor offers additional funding that we believe should work. Digitally, easily, quickly, securely, flexibly and, above all, accessible when needed and outside the bank.</desc>    <g transform="matrix(7.66917,0,0,7.66917,2,148.632)">        <path id="Combined-Shape" d="M2,16l14,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-14,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm9,-8l14,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-14,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm-9,0l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm15,-8l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm7,16l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm-22,-16l7,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-7,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm9,24l7,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-7,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Zm-9,0l1,0c1.105,0 2,0.895 2,2c0,1.105 -0.895,2 -2,2l-1,0c-1.105,0 -2,-0.895 -2,-2c0,-1.105 0.895,-2 2,-2Z" style="fill:rgb(0,229,158);fill-rule:nonzero;"/>        <path id="debtor" d="M50.915,2.526l0,22.948l-4.447,0l-0.254,-1.917c-1.186,1.629 -2.785,2.443 -4.797,2.443c-2.097,0 -3.69,-0.783 -4.781,-2.351c-1.091,-1.567 -1.636,-3.711 -1.636,-6.433c0,-1.67 0.286,-3.164 0.858,-4.484c0.572,-1.32 1.382,-2.351 2.43,-3.093c1.048,-0.742 2.25,-1.113 3.605,-1.113c1.61,0 2.944,0.515 4.003,1.546l0,-8.072l5.019,0.526Zm-7.942,19.886c1.165,0 2.139,-0.618 2.923,-1.855l0,-7.083c-0.402,-0.474 -0.81,-0.825 -1.223,-1.051c-0.413,-0.227 -0.884,-0.341 -1.414,-0.341c-0.932,0 -1.673,0.423 -2.223,1.269c-0.551,0.845 -0.826,2.144 -0.826,3.896c0,1.918 0.238,3.258 0.714,4.021c0.477,0.763 1.16,1.144 2.049,1.144Zm26.589,-5.474c0,0.681 -0.032,1.268 -0.095,1.763l-10.451,0c0.169,1.381 0.571,2.351 1.207,2.907c0.635,0.557 1.514,0.835 2.636,0.835c0.678,0 1.335,-0.118 1.97,-0.355c0.635,-0.237 1.323,-0.603 2.065,-1.098l2.065,2.721c-1.97,1.526 -4.162,2.289 -6.576,2.289c-2.732,0 -4.829,-0.783 -6.29,-2.351c-1.461,-1.567 -2.192,-3.67 -2.192,-6.309c0,-1.67 0.307,-3.17 0.921,-4.5c0.615,-1.33 1.515,-2.381 2.701,-3.154c1.185,-0.774 2.604,-1.16 4.256,-1.16c2.436,0 4.342,0.742 5.718,2.227c1.377,1.484 2.065,3.546 2.065,6.185Zm-4.924,-1.392c-0.042,-2.515 -0.953,-3.773 -2.732,-3.773c-0.868,0 -1.54,0.309 -2.017,0.928c-0.476,0.619 -0.768,1.639 -0.873,3.062l5.622,0l0,-0.217Zm17.313,-7.02c2.012,0 3.558,0.768 4.638,2.304c1.08,1.536 1.62,3.685 1.62,6.448c0,1.691 -0.27,3.196 -0.81,4.516c-0.54,1.319 -1.313,2.35 -2.319,3.093c-1.006,0.742 -2.197,1.113 -3.574,1.113c-0.91,0 -1.742,-0.186 -2.493,-0.557c-0.752,-0.371 -1.393,-0.886 -1.922,-1.546l-0.254,1.577l-4.448,0l0,-22.948l5.019,-0.526l0,8.722c0.509,-0.681 1.16,-1.217 1.954,-1.609c0.794,-0.391 1.657,-0.587 2.589,-0.587Zm-1.906,13.917c1.97,0 2.954,-1.721 2.954,-5.165c0,-1.958 -0.233,-3.309 -0.699,-4.051c-0.465,-0.742 -1.143,-1.114 -2.033,-1.114c-1.122,0 -2.075,0.64 -2.859,1.918l0,6.835c0.318,0.495 0.705,0.881 1.16,1.16c0.455,0.278 0.948,0.417 1.477,0.417Zm21.887,2.258c-0.614,0.412 -1.329,0.732 -2.144,0.959c-0.815,0.227 -1.625,0.34 -2.43,0.34c-3.685,-0.021 -5.528,-2 -5.528,-5.938l0,-7.608l-2.382,0l0,-3.402l2.382,0l0,-3.557l5.02,-0.557l0,4.114l3.875,0l-0.54,3.402l-3.335,0l0,7.546c0,0.763 0.127,1.309 0.381,1.639c0.254,0.33 0.656,0.495 1.207,0.495c0.572,0 1.175,-0.175 1.811,-0.526l1.683,3.093Zm8.99,-16.175c2.584,0 4.606,0.768 6.068,2.304c1.461,1.536 2.192,3.685 2.192,6.448c0,1.753 -0.334,3.284 -1.001,4.593c-0.667,1.309 -1.62,2.325 -2.859,3.047c-1.239,0.721 -2.706,1.082 -4.4,1.082c-2.562,0 -4.579,-0.768 -6.051,-2.304c-1.472,-1.536 -2.208,-3.686 -2.208,-6.449c0,-1.752 0.333,-3.283 1.001,-4.592c0.667,-1.31 1.62,-2.325 2.859,-3.047c1.238,-0.721 2.705,-1.082 4.399,-1.082Zm0,3.587c-1.016,0 -1.779,0.418 -2.287,1.253c-0.508,0.835 -0.762,2.129 -0.762,3.881c0,1.794 0.248,3.104 0.746,3.928c0.498,0.825 1.265,1.237 2.303,1.237c1.017,0 1.779,-0.417 2.287,-1.252c0.509,-0.835 0.763,-2.129 0.763,-3.882c0,-1.793 -0.249,-3.103 -0.747,-3.927c-0.497,-0.825 -1.265,-1.238 -2.303,-1.238Zm20.394,-3.525c0.615,0 1.176,0.072 1.684,0.216l-0.794,4.732c-0.636,-0.144 -1.144,-0.216 -1.525,-0.216c-0.995,0 -1.752,0.335 -2.271,1.005c-0.519,0.67 -0.927,1.675 -1.223,3.015l0,8.134l-5.019,0l0,-16.422l4.383,0l0.413,3.185c0.382,-1.134 0.959,-2.026 1.732,-2.675c0.773,-0.65 1.646,-0.974 2.62,-0.974Z" style="fill:rgb(0,84,80);"/>    </g></svg>
