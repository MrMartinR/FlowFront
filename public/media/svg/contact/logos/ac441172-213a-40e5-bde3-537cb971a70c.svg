Submission to enforcement in a notarial deed gives the creditor, claiming his claims, the opportunity to apply to the court for the enforcement clause. If you already have a notarial deed with such a clause, you can in turn go to the bailiff with the request to initiate execution. Therefore, without having to conduct a lawsuit, he may demand payment, with the help of a bailiff who will execute the entire property of the debtor.</desc>    <g
